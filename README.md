# Solve System of Equations Using Python

###This is a group project for Math400 at San Francisco State University
#### Authors: a group of Students in the class

## The project is divided to 3 sections,
### Project Problems

1. Section 1: Solve the nonlinear system using Newton’s method with the given initial vector. Terminate the process when the maximum norm of the difference between successive iterates is less than 5 × 10−6.
2. Section 2: Use both the Jacobi method and the Gauss-Seidel method to solve the indicated linear system of equations. Your code should efficiently use the “sparseness” of the coefficient matrix. Take x(0) = 0, and terminate the iteration when ||x(k+1) − x(k)||∞ falls below 5 × 10−6. Record the number of iterations required to achieve convergence.
3. will be added
